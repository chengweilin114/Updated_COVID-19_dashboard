# Covid-19 tableau workbook

![](image/visual.jpg)

Speaking of the 2020 review, I think the first thing many people think of is the epidemic COVID-19, and so am I. The COVID-19 has greatly changed peopleâ€™s behavior patterns and they have become accustomed to working from home, called delivery.
People are beginning to have a sense of safe social distancing. Our lives have been greatly affected and changed. Therefore, I want to insights the data and use data to tell stories.
